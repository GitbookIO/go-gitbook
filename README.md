# go-gitbook

Go client for the GitBook API, generated using [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

## Development

To generate the client, run:

```shell
make
```

⚠️ The code generator doesn't work at the moment, likely because of [this
bug](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/14317).
